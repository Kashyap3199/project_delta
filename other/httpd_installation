How To Install the Apache Web Server on CentOS?
Step 1 — Installing Apache

Apache is available within CentOS’s default software repositories, which means you can install it with the yum package manager.

As the non-root sudo user configured in the prerequisites, update the local Apache httpd package index to reflect the latest upstream changes:

sudo yum update httpd
Once the packages are updated, install the Apache package:

sudo yum install httpd
After confirming the installation, yum will install Apache and all required dependencies
