<h1 style="color:darkgoldenrod">IDEA​</h1>
<p>Website xyz.com has got some security features embedded in it. The base level starts with the creation of a Domain, setting up the VM server, adding users, computers, and the webpage to the local Active Directory, and later integrating it to Azure and handling things on both on-premises and the cloud. The access logs, error logs, and application logs of the user are also stored in splunk on regular basis. If there are any changes made to the protected information such as password, address, and SSN. It can be easily identified in splunk as it creates a record/ log. These are inside threats, and they can be found on the logs. We are using ossec as a SCANNER for our VM. OSSEC is an open-source host-based intrusion detection system that can be used to keep track of server activity and its analytics. It is used to monitor our server in server/agent mode and give you a real-time view of what’s happening on your server. This website handles the security parameters such as password strength detection, user identity, and authentication, Encoding the readable text, and generating a cipher text. In order to generate huge traffic to the website, we are using various tools, so that it will be easier to visualize, analyse and investigate the data in a better way. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a one-stop solution to all security risks with a simplified interface. ​
